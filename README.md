# fcc-tribute-page
2nd Project to earn the freeCodeCamp "(New) responsive web desing" certification.

This project needs to looks similar to this one: https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/
We are allowed to choose a fictional o real character of our choice. I chose Lemmy Kilmister, bassist and lead singer of Motorhead.
All the code was made using vanilla HTML and CSS from scratch.
