                    failed to raise enough interest with
                    their singles.</li>
                <li><span class="yeartext">1971</span> Lemmy auditioned for the space rock band “hawkwind” but the band
                    decides that they not need
                    another guitarrist. By chance, the player bass doesn’t shows up so he took his place and became the
                    basisst. Lemmy provided a distinctive bass work sound during his tenure and also lead vocals on
                    several
                    songs included band’s biggest UK chart single, “silver machine”, which rated #3 in 1972.</li>

                    was released without charge,
                    but the band decided to fire him.
                    <ul>
                        <li>After hawkwind, Lemmy formed a new band called “bastards”, with guitarrist Larry Wallis and
                            drummer Lucas Fox. Their manager told him that the band name would never get a slot on “Top
                            of
                            the Pops”. So Lemmy changed the band’s name to Mothorhead, the title of the last song he had
                            written for Hawkwind.</li>
                        <li>Wallis and fox where replaced with “fast” Eddie Clarke as drummer and Phil “Philty Animal”
                            Taylor, and with this line-up, the band began to achieve success.</li>
